During 2005–2009, he was a Senior Research Scientist and then Associate Professor from 2009 to 2014. He is currently a Professor. He has engaged in both passive and active microwave remote sensing for several applications viz. soil moisture, flood mapping, and land use/land cover. He has participated in several spaceborne campaigns for collecting synchronous ground-truth data and has experience in handling various datasets for several applications. His current research interests include the application of polarimetry for geophysical parameter retrieval and SAR interferometry for DEM and displacement map generation.</span></p>
